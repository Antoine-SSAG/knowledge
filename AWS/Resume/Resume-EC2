-EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud)
  -Princing model 
	-On demand (No long term commitment)
	-Reserved (Reservation, cheaper the more you reserve, contract between 1 and 3 years) 
	-Spot (Bid price on compute, used for flexible start and ends compute)
	  -If instance is terminated by AWS then you're not charged )
	-Dedicated Hosts (Physical server dedicated fo you (for license or regulation))
  -EBS (Elastic Block store)
	-Additionnal volume are not deleted when you terminate the EC2 instance 
  	-Types:
	  -General Purpose SSD
	  -Provisioned IOPS SSD --> High perf SSD
	  -Throughput Optimzed HDD
	  -Cold HDD --> Lowest cost available 
	  -EBS Magnetic
	-To migrate an EC2 instance, you have to create a snaphsot of it, use it as an AMI and lauch the AMI in the new AZ 
  -EFS (Elastic File System)
	-Based on NFSv4
	-Read after write consistency 
  -Placement group (Name must be unique in AWS account)
	-Clustured Placement group -> Low latency/High Network Throughput (can't span multiple AZ)
	-Spread placemnt group  -> Individual Critical EC2 instances (Only 7 running instance per AZ)
	-Partitionned  -> Multiples EC2 instances (HDSFS,HBase and Cassandra cluster)
	-Can't move an existing instance into a placement group
